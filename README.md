## My first JavaScript &amp; CSS component library

I have a quite a bit of my own JavaScript and CSS code that I re-use on a regular basis. I would like to put them all in one place, this is the place!

### ADDED SO FAR!
1. popup (JavaScript and CSS Pop Up Box). [HERE](https://github.com/mxfoyster/componentlibrary1/tree/main/popup)
2. menu (PHP and CSS nav bar). [HERE](https://github.com/mxfoyster/componentlibrary1/tree/main/menu)
3. gallery (JavaScript and CSS gallery utilising HTML Canvas). [HERE](https://github.com/mxfoyster/componentlibrary1/tree/main/gallery)

Click the link for each project which each has it's own readme with screenshots, implementation guides and change logs.

These will all be ongoing projects.

The files in the root (and css subdirectory) of the repo comprise of a simple PHP website demonstrating implementation further.
